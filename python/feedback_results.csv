For matrices, I found the superimposition technique better than the juxtaposition because the information was more compact, easier to read and you didn't have to look back and forth all the time. Furthermore I personally would prefer the Timeline in any case over the Animation, because you have to look at everything much more stressed during the animation and if you miss something you have to watch the whole animation again to see the part that you missed again. In addition, the timeline is much more relaxed because you can determine how long you want to view a certain diagram and you can jump back and forth between diagrams with one click to see differences There were in generel way too much vertices, so it took quite long to find a solution for the questions."

4,B,0d215911-e63c-46ad-a063-653b709f8253,5,2,4,2,3,4,4,1,"Animations seemed really impractical for the exercises since you can not keep working on one graph and in some of the problems you could not start working on another graph before finishing the previous one since it would have been way too much information to handle. The only upside to it was that I had to work efficiently since i only had a certain amount of time at my disposal for a every graph (I often had to wait for the graph to show up again since i couldnt finish the exercise in time though which costs time again). The JP- and TL-Graphs were the most comfortable ones for me. JP-Graphs were more comfortable with NL-Visualizations since it was easier to orient myself in the next graph again. SI seemed to work well with Matrices, because I didnt have to reorient myself in the new graphs again since everything was shown in one matrix. However, SI-Visualizations with NL-Graphs got too crowded for me and therefore it was hard to identify the exercise's solution properly."

Maybe it was just me but I had to search the given nodes multiple times per question. Marking them would have been helpful unless it was  intentionally not marked.

7,B,1039ad57-5293-4af8-acce-89edd244cc7a,3,4,5,4,2,1,2,3,I thought that in general the node link graph visualisation was just much more easy to understand and to extract information from.

9,B,11834541,3,4,3,2,1,4,2,1,"For me, the matrix graph visualizations have been more difficult than the node-link especially because of the name of the nodes. It was difficult for me to find them because there were for instance KX42 and KB81 so very alike and the matrix was big so I often chose the wrong column or line. The superimposition is in my opinion the one with the most visibility maybe because of the colors it was easy for me to follow. 
The animation technique was the most complicated (matrix and node-link)because the maximum time was of 7 seconds and it is not enough to check all edges between nodes especially when we had to check the maximum clique. 
I prefer the node-link diagrams because I can see the edges better and get the overall image. Sometimes when the edges are over others, I did pick them with the mouse and they were moving so I could get another view of them and see the information I needed. "

11,B,172858e8-7087-4555-8a79-33f52f458ff9,3,1,2,1,5,4,1,1,"NL JP: Node links were hard to observe in general. The hold-release function wasn't helpful. Juxtaposition was probably the easiest version of node links to work with.
NL SI: The colored lines (especially because of the low choice of colors) were confusing, and for some graphs, some lines were invisible.
NL AN: This one was useful for only one specific type of task (Calculating degree of one node). Other than that, the maximum time (7 seconds) wasn't enough for most of the tasks.
NL TL: This would be the second easiest one to read. But still not a solution to the complexity of node links.
M JP: Since the index indicator stays the same for each matrix, this one was the most practical one to work with.
M SI: This one was also useful, but requires a bigger screen to obtain information quickly.
M AN: Again, the time slots were too short. A ""pause"", ""previous"" and ""next"" options might make it better, but still there were easier options for each task.
M TL: After changing between timestamps, the indicator gets lost and because of the complexity and the size of the matrix, it's hard to concentrate again."

(2) It was also a lot of cognitive effort to remember the state of the graphs and refer back to the time interval shown on the left of the screen to see what the current time interval was. It would be better to center the controls in the middle top of the screen, or make it more visible somehow while simultaneously looking at the graphs. 
(3) It was very hard to control the node-link graphs when trying to move vertices around. Maybe that was intentional.

Superimposition is clearly better for the most part, but still suffers from really bad usability - again I prefer node link over matrix. Juxtaposition and timeline are clearly the best options, although it is still quite tiresome to read more complex informations from the graphs. With those two encodings, node link is still generally preferrable for more complex informations, but with more dense graphs the preference will clearly shift towards matrices, simply because informations become unreadable at a certain point."

Animation made it harder to count degrees/clique size overall. I found Node Link in combination with the Timeline to be the most readable format, since you could already zoom in to the nodes that concerned you and then jump between the different times easily, without losing focus. Juxtaposition worked best in Matrix Format, since the resulting thick lines in the node link format overlapped often and covered each other up, which made it easy to overlook a single connection."

Overall, the clique tasks where very tedious.
Furthermore the graphs with the animations where really poorly implemented, since there was no way to pause is. Combine it with with one of the clique tasks, and you would want to hurt yourself out of frustration. 
The colored time graph tasks where really difficult, when there were to many edges, since they overlapped, and dragging them around only helped temporary, since they wouldnt stay in that position. 
Another thing, on tasks, where you had to calculate stuff, it was really annoying, to focus (css) on the answer field, since you couldn't copy paste the name of a node and ctrl+F search for it in the browser. "

Was quite ok, but very awkward in the matrix display.

Superimposition:
Was very pleasant and easy to handle in the matrix as well as in the node link representation. My personal favourite.

Animation:
Was impractical in every respect, sometimes it was too fast sometimes too slow. You could choose the time yourself, but if you had to count several links, for example, and you were too slow in one time frame, you had to wait for all of them again to be able to continue.

Timeline:
Was very flexible, much better than the animation, you could choose when to move to the next timeslice.

Furthermore, I was very often unsure whether the solution was right. With these examples I found it easier to use the matrices. Furthermore, it was almost impossible to find the solution via the animations, as there was far too little time.
The examples with the relations were by far the easiest for me and I was able to complete them well for every type of graph. Since only one relation was asked, this could be recognized in graphs just as well as in the matrices.
The degree examples were also feasible in all graphs, whereby graphs with a large number of lines were challenging. The relationships were far easier to recognize in matrices.
In general, it was very difficult to see something in graphs with many relations. This was not the problem with matrices. Furthermore, I also found the superimposition and the timeline to be the best way to find the solution."

Personally, it took me 2 hours to manage to complete this survey, even though i skipped out on the most complex ones (maximum cliques over a large graph are a hard problem, especially talking about temporal changes). This was also due to the fact that the study suddenly reloaded after i was halfway through with it and i had to do everything over again.

Secondly, there were some pointless and outright weird questions in there, but i assume this is by choice.

On one instance I entered 0 as a result and it got rejected with the message, that valid answers are in the 0-30 range. I consider this weird behavior.

Also, the graph visualization could have been better: Dragging nodes around would not work and would instead make them snap back into position while additionally making the whole graph wiggle and reorder. Also, the information density was far too high with font frequently overlapping even gray graphes (it was even worse for SI, for obvious reasons).

Finally, the rating is a bit problematic: It hugely depends on the type of tasks which technique is best."

This became basically impossible and extremely exhausting with animations, since there was not enough time to focus and count without being able to pause the animation, and juxtapositions, as the large matrixes became so small that I could barely find the combinations, despite working on a 32'' screen. I think across the variety of tasks, the graphs with timelines were the most simple and eye-friendly variety."
32,B,4faecf20-619a-4628-a622-57ffe9ef1751,3,4,4,2,2,3,3,1,"Overall, I disliked the Animation Technique the most due to the fact, that you could not pause the animation. Especially for graphs with such high numbers of nodes, it is just very difficult for the reader to instantly find the nodes of the task, even worse with time pressure. It does a little bit better with Node-Link representation, if you have memorized the placements of your needed nodes, but is still kind of unhandy. The other techniques do better, whereat it depends on the task, which one is better. For finding the absolute number of changes, the Node-Link representation I always favored than the Matrix representation, personally I could never see how the nodes where connected in the Matrix represenation, I always had to use a sheet of paper to visualize the connections as a node-link-graph."

37,B,603f9c2d-0a24-4dba-bf49-1a66bbb9437d,4,2,5,3,1,1,1,1,"I liked the NL with a TL the most, as it allows one to scroll through time and re-watch changes one wants to track. This is why I didn't like the Animation as much, as it doesn't allow one to control time and therefore one has to re-watch the whole animation.
The NL JP is the second best option in my opinion, as it allows one to freely move around in time (just like the TL). However, it has the disadvantage that it does not allow for one to stay zoomed in on a part of the graph while moving through time like the TL does.
The one NL I didn't like as much was the SI, as it's thick edges always occluded some other edge that I needed to analyze. Once the edges didn't occlude another anymore it was quite easy to read the needed information, though not as easy as NL TL.
I absolutely hated the Matrix visualizations in all of their variations. Essentially, to read any information from the matrix, I had to reconstruct the graph from the matrix and then gather the needed information. The NL is a lot more intuitive and doesn't have to be decoded like the matrix."

It was practically useless for counting tasks, especially in M.
Timeline was my overall favourite since it allowed me to directly compare timesteps with each other. Though in the matrix representation it was quiet easy to loose track of where I was when I had to change the timestep.
SI was really confusing for some of the NL tasks but really usefull for many of the M tasks. 
JP was solid in both cases, though I felt it didn't really shine in any for comprehensibility. 
One thing I feel would have been highly benefical in every method, especially in for JP in M would have been the possibility to select fields as that would have made comparrison sooo much easier. 
Everything clique related was easier to understand in NL view in my opinion."
40,B,78b9a69e-7ab0-4c26-bb02-21125956bd0a,3,2,5,4,3,3,5,2,"I think it mostly depends on o the task that needs to be completed. For some more complex tasks such as finding the biggest clip size or calculating the absolute change in the clip size, the representation through linked nodes is far superior to the matrix representation, especially when combined with a time slider (Animation and Juxtaposition are nice too, but Superimposition tends to be too messy). On the other hand, finding a degree of a node or tracking its absolute change tends to be faster with a matrix representation, especially in dense graphs. Superimposition tends to be the messiest approach, but it does provide good results with graphs that are not dense, or when looking at a behaviour of a single node through time. "

having no control over the animation is really bad when trying to solve this tasks

having not all time slices super imposed is nice for the node-link representation, since the graph is more easily parsable. Using the timeline in this case is perfect, since it keeps the node in place (on the screen) and changes can be easily read.

for the matrix it is easier to see all information at once (SI), since it's hard to keep track of changes

The Animation made things really hard because it went too fast and you could not pause it. I really liked the timeline feature because it was very easy to switch between timesteps and see the differences. I also liked Juxtaposition, altough it was not as easy to spot differences, especially in the Node-Link diagrams."

I don't know if it was intended, but it was sometimes a problem that you can't stop the animation."

Timeline examples sometimes were very easy to distinguish but if the information only varied by a little bit it was very frustrating to count within the 7 second limit. I found it hard to concentrate throughout the whole test, even with some lengthy breaks. About 7 graphs did not load and I was not able to answer those questions, upon reloading I had to start the test again the first time which was frustrating. I marked the graphs that I could not see with 1 star confidence. "
60,B,d5955ba3-7b8c-4c62-8bd4-34bf2fb0917a,4,3,5,3,3,2,2,1,"Personally Node-Linked visualizations are easier to analyze than Matrix visualizations. 
Having all Timesteps in the same visualization (Superimposition) is way worse for Matrices than for NLs. While I don't think there is a big difference between Juxtaposition and Timeline represantations I liked the Timeline ever so slightly more.
Matrices, especially large ones, are very time consuming to analyze compared to a graph where one directly sees a edge between two vertices."

Unfortunately I don't know what NL and M stands for that's why I gave the same rating. "
62,A,d62df781-2a6e-4407-8f4b-5cadc071292e,4,2,5,1,4,4,5,1," ""JP, SI, AN and TL"" and ""NL and M"" could have just been typed out instead of abbreviated, it took me some minutes to understand the question and there is enough space to not abbreviate it. Apart from that I found the animations very hard in some cases because if you have to count 20 nodes and the maximum animation time is 7 seconds it's very cumbersome to remember where you stopped and wait until the right timestamp appears again. Timeline to me is the same as animation, with the huge advantage of being able to decide when I'm ready to advance to the next timestamp. Superimposition was kind of hard to read when there are many nodes in the node-link diagram. Juxtaposition was alright for me in both cases."

- The superimposition exercises in matrix format had a quite good readability. In the graph type exercises though I had a difficult time to catch every information due to visual cluster."

the ""find the greatest clique accross all timestamps"" are incredibly frustrating to work through. One need's external tools and without marking points it can be quite nerve-wracking
the sumperimposition tasks were quite nice but sometimes the overlap between the lines made it very hard to find the answer even when knowing exactly what to look for.
i realise the need for the naming scheme but some questions became a lot harder than they would have been with simple A,B,C,D... names. (having to remember what nodes this task asks for)
the question design - explaining how to sum up the absolute change every time - made it harder to actually read the question, which is why i think more people will fall for the trick questions."

As for the graph encodings I liked the timeline a lot. It was easy to navigate and very intuitive. I really disliked the Animation though. With a feature like a pause button for example it would have been a lot easier to answer these specific questions.
Juxtapostion and Superimposition had both it's positive and negative points. "

JP was hard to compare on Matrixes, but I liked it on graphs, while SI was the other way around as it got very hard to read on the graphs."

Over all the node-link graphs were far better than the matrices. The superimposition graphs got quite crowded, espacially the NL-SI was sometimes impossible to read. Juxtaposition is also perfectly fine, although as said, timeline is in my opinion the best option."
